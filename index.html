    <h3 class="sectiontitle">Putting in Work</h3> 
    <p class="para">At this point in my life I am extremely close to entering the professional realm of society. I currently
	have one semester left at IIT until graduation, where my focuses revolve around Engineering Management &#91;Mechanical Eng.&#93;
  and Information Security. Every time I say that it becomes more much apparent how little
	time there is separating me from that milestone. The people that I have chosen to surround myself with these
	past few years have shown me one very important thing, networking is &#34;Golden&#34;. Even though I&#39;ve stretched
	myself quite thin at times I can proudly say that being on the Executive Board for four, going on five, 
	organizations on campus and taking classes in almost every college you&#39;d frequently hear about at IIT, 
	has given me a more vivid picture of the immediate environment surrounding my life. In simpler words,
	I&#39;m a cool dude and I gravitate towards all the other cool people no matter where I find myself. The final
	decision on whether or not I should find myself a second Minor or take a shot at a Master&#39;s is still up 
	in the air, but I shall decide soon enough. But until then I will keep striving forward and put in &#34;Work&#34; 
	like mama told me.</p>

    <h3 class="sectiontitle">My Interests</h3>  
    <p>This is quite an expansive topic but to make things clear I&#39;ll use some of the html code that has graced
	my skill set.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Anime</li>
      <li>Coding</li>
      <li>Cars &amp; Auto Racing</li>
      <li>Exercise/Health</li>
      <li>Fashion</li>
      <li>Investing</li>
      <li>Engineering</li>
      <li>Pets</li>
      <li>Personal Finance</li>
      <li>Cooking</li>
      <li>Languages</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I would like to say that I haven&#39;t fully incorporated all of these into my life yet; there are still a few 
	that will take a bit more time to fully set in, but good change comes to those who are patient &#91;and diligent&#93;.</p>
